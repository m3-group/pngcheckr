pngcheckr
=========

A wrapper around the pngcheck library allowing you to check folders recursively.

Note: to download the required pngcheck utility, you can use homebrew ("brew install") or probably another package manager like MacPorts. The pngcheck utility's repo is available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/png-mng/files/pngcheck/2.3.0/
